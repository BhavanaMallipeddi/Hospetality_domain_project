Atliq Grand is experiencing a decline in market share and revenue within the business and luxury categories of hotels. This decline is attributed to strategic moves made by competitors and ineffective decision-making within Atliq Grand’s management.
The Managing Director of Atliq Grand aims to regain market share and revenue by implementing data-driven decisions.
